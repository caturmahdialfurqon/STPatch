## ‚úé·ù∞. Note :

For Windows Users you don't need to run the script. Sorry I don't know how to use this "CMD" thing, it gives me a headache, <br>
So here are some steps: (this works for many windows users in my Forum members.)
- SublimeText Build `4180`
> * Install [HxD-Editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20#) or visit the [website version](https://hexed.it/) `if you don't want to install it.`
> * Copy File sublime_text.exe (-> Open -> C:\Program Files\Sublime Text\sublime_text.exe") to any folder.
> * **(DON'T FORGET TO BACKUP YOUR EXE FILE)**
> * Open sublime_text.exe on hexed
> * Go to Search and in "Search for" put: 80 79 05 00 0F 94 C2
> * In Search Type select "Enable replace" and put: C6 41 05 01 B2 00 90
> * Click "Find next" then "Replace"
> * Click "Save as" then name it: sublime_text.exe
> * Copy your modified sublime_text.exe to directory Sublime Text (C:\Program Files\Sublime Text\)
- If it still doesn't work after patching (don't delete the modified file) try opening CMD then:
  - $ cd C:/Program Files/Sublime Text
  - $ icacls sublime_text.exe /grant:r "Administrators:(OI)(CI)F" "%USERNAME%:(OI)(CI)F"
